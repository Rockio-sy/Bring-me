Steps to create the UnitTest after first try :
1_ Add Spring Boot Starter Test dependencies (done via pom.xml).
2_ Ensure the program runs to check everything is in place.
3_ Write test classes that follow the same package structure as the main classes.
4_ Test different scenarios with assertions to check the correct behavior.
5_ Run tests with Maven or within the IDE, and check for test results.

For the behaviors inside the test class :
Arrange, Act, Assert
