Save the user id only for now in the token!
*** --> (Find In Google)4_ we have to check the json response for every endpoint csu there are some fields that do not necessary to show to the client-side.
6_ in the future i have to update the program to use Username instead of email of phone for login
7_ Ask for ItemController (validating token is right ?, how do i set the user id in the request)
8_ Ask if we have to check the user id after extracting it from the token if it is null or no! (PersonController::37)
