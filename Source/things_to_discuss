1_ to get the user_id i want to use WEB token, and i will not use @PathVariable, or body, cus it will be hackable.
2_ After checking if the user exists , should i return the user or only message that it is exists (Status code FORBIDDEN 403)!
3_ I cannot move on without springSecurity, so i have to implement it !
