1_ I cannot perform the user to upload hte photo then create the item, why ?
    1_ I have to save the photo with the item id and user's id, and i cannot take the item id without saving it in the database
    #_ I can do it by saving the photo temporary and wait till the user finishes then i can save it (this approach will take long time and will complicate the process)
    $_ Best practice, allow the user to upload the photo and check it type or if it is empty then return a temp_name to the client-side, client-side will set the temp_name in JSON request and photo will be saved in the createNewItem function(endpoint).
    0_ I have to set a mechanism to clean the temp files if the user did not send the createNewItem request.
2_ Should i add function to check if the photo exists in the data base, since i encode the name with currentTimeMiles?
3_ Do i need to set teh user_id in the photo filename ?? (i save the file name in database, and the column is in the item table, so i can simply get the name and add the path, then get the file!
4_ I save the photo in folder cus i cannot use Cloud memo, but when the user asks for an item, should i send him the encoded path for the photo, or the decoded path?, and why if this or this ?
